# Boston-Housing-Analysis

The Boston Housing Analysis project focuses on investigating the factors that influence housing prices in the Boston area. Using the Boston Housing dataset, the analysis explores key variables such as the crime rate, number of rooms, and distance to employment centers, to better understand their relationships with house prices. The dataset used in this project contains various features, and through careful data exploration, I selected relevant columns for deeper analysis while excluding those that were less impactful, such as `CHAS`, `NOX`, `B`, and `LSTAT`.

The project involves several steps, beginning with basic data exploration and visualization. Histograms were generated for each variable to observe their distributions, followed by a scatter plot to examine the correlation between crime rate and housing prices. Furthermore, key statistical measures were calculated, such as the average number of rooms per dwelling and the percentage of homes priced under $20,000. 

This project utilized Python as the primary programming language, with libraries like Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib for visualizations. The analysis revealed an inverse relationship between crime rates and house prices, and approximately 41.5% of houses in the dataset were priced below $20,000. The findings provide an interesting perspective on housing in Boston, and future extensions of the analysis could include predictive modeling to forecast house prices using various factors in the dataset. The project can be reproduced by running the `boston_analysis.ipynb` file included in the repository.
